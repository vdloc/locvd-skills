# Human-in-the-Loop

Why it matters: Fully automated AI systems risk critical errors and lack transparency. Users need review and override capabilities for safety and trust.

## The moves

1. **First, decide if the human can actually say no.** Human-in-the-loop is only a loop if the human can break it. If reject is buried, the context is missing, or overruling the AI gets the reviewer second-guessed, you have a spectator, not an approver. Design the no before you design the yes.
2. **Route by stakes, not by reflex.** Reviewing everything trains people to review nothing. Auto-resolve the cases the AI is reliably right on and reserve a human for the consequential and uncertain ones. The fewer items in the queue, the more likely each one actually gets read.
3. **Approving has to cost something to mean something.** If approve is one click and there is no consequence for waving through a bad call, you have built a rubber stamp. Show the reviewer what they are signing, make reject as easy as approve, and record who approved on what evidence. A click is not a review.
4. **Give the reviewer enough to overrule, not just to agree.** Confidence, reason, and the raw content the user saw are the minimum. A reviewer who only sees the AI's verdict will defer to it every time. Show the work behind the call so a human can disagree with it.
5. **A rubber stamp is worse than honest automation.** Full automation at least admits no one looked. A review queue people click through manufactures a 'human-approved' record on top of an unreviewed decision and parks a person in the blame seat. If you can't make the review real, don't fake it: automate openly and own the risk.

When this applies, make the smallest change that genuinely realises the pattern. Do not add UI the product does not need, and say what you changed and why.
