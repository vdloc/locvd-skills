# Workspace-Native Agent Integration

Why it matters: AI agents are being added to existing professional tools but feel like separate tools, creating context-switching overhead.

## The moves

1. **Anchor the agent to the artifact, not the app.** The agent should act on the document, ticket, or message in focus. If it can't see what the user sees, it's just another chatbot with extra steps.
2. **Make invocation zero-cost or automatic.** Every required click to summon the agent is a reason not to use it. Trigger on selection, on pause, or on explicit shortcut, never on navigation.
3. **Output must land where the work lands.** Suggestions shown in a side panel get ignored. Output inserted inline, into the actual artifact, gets used. Place the result where the cursor already is.
4. **Let users ignore the agent without penalty.** Inline AI that demands resolution before the user can continue is a blocker, not a collaborator. Dismiss must always be one key or zero clicks.

When this applies, make the smallest change that genuinely realises the pattern. Do not add UI the product does not need, and say what you changed and why.
